            <p>
                We are a community focused on improving the lives of all sentient beings in the present and future&mdash;including humans, non-human animals, and digital minds.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have two online community hubs:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Hive Slack:</b> The <code>#c-longtermism</code> channel. You can join Hive <a href="https://joinhive.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                    <li><b>Discord server:</b> Join <a href="https://discord.gg/KVf7qFmMrX" target="_blank">here</a></li>
                    <li><b>Monthly community calls:</b> TODO</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </main>

                    TODO: Choose a CC license (BY, BY-SA, or BY-NC-SA). Since CC licenses are irrevocable, it is possible to "upgrade" content to a more permissive license (one that grants a superset of the rights granted by the previous license) but not to retroactively "downgrade" to a more conservative one (one that grants a strict subset of rights). I would prefer to use a free license (BY-SA or BY), but Animal Ethics uses BY-NC-SA and compatibility with their license might be important. Hence we are using the most conservative CC license for now as it gives us the most flexibility to choose a more permissive license later, but signals that we want to use the CC system.
